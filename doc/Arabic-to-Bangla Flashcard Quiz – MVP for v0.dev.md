## User Stories

**Persona: Bangla-speaking Learner**

* As a Bangla-speaking learner, I want to start a vocabulary quiz instantly, so that I can learn Arabic words without setup or login.

* As a Bangla-speaking learner, I want every quiz session to present up to 10 multiple-choice questions, so that each session fits easily into my daily routine.

* As a Bangla-speaking learner, I want the app to automatically select which words to review based on past performance, so that I can focus more on words I struggle with.

* As a Bangla-speaking learner, I want to see immediate feedback at the end of each quiz, so that I know what I got wrong and where to improve.

* As a privacy-sensitive user, I want all my quiz history to remain on my device, so that I never risk sharing data unintentionally.

---

## User Experience

**Entry Point & First-Time User Experience**

* User visits the v0.dev app or a custom-deployed URL; no login/sign-up required.

* The home page greets users with a clear "Start Quiz" button, displays number of words due for review today (if any), and an optional link to adjust display size or contrast.

* For first-time users, a single modal or in-page explanation (max 2–3 lines) introduces: "Learn Arabic words fast—take a short quiz; we handle which words to show, you handle the answers. All progress stays on this device."

* No lengthy onboarding or required tutorial; optional help text only.

**Core Experience**

* **Step 1:** User clicks "Start Quiz."

  * The system gathers up to 10 words ready for review (or as many as available) and displays the first question.

  * Arabic word appears at the top, with 4 Bangla options (1 correct, 3 distractors), with large font and strong contrast.

  * All UI labels and navigation use Bangla, but questions are always Arabic-to-Bangla.

  * Users select an answer—immediate visual feedback (e.g., highlight correct/wrong) may flash briefly.

  * "Next" button appears; user proceeds through all questions in sequence.

* **Step 2:** Final question submitted.

  * Session summary appears, highlighting total correct, incorrect, and listing mistakes ("Words to Review Again").

  * Encouraging message; single click to return home or "Review Again" (reshuffles for next spaced session if possible).

* **Step 3:** Spaced repetition schedule updates automatically; next session surfaces overdue/mistaken words.

  * If too few words are due, user is notified and invited to return later.

* **Step 4:** Optional: User may clear/reset all data from settings.

**Advanced Features & Edge Cases**

* If less than 10 words are due, present as many as available (never repeat in same session).

* If all words are newly correct, review interval increases (basic SRS).

* If no words are due, display a friendly “You’re all caught up!” message.

* Accessibility: All flows work with keyboard navigation and screen readers; clear visible focus states.

**UI/UX Highlights**

* Strict font and color contrast minimums (WCAG AA/AAA)

* Right-to-left support for Arabic, left-to-right for Bangla

* Responsive layout for phones, tablets, and desktops

* Font size adjustment or "easy read" mode toggle

* All button and touch targets meet minimum sizing guidelines

## Narrative

Mina, a Bangla speaker keen to acquire Arabic vocabulary, finds a simple link to the Arabic-to-Bangla Flashcard Quiz. Upon visiting the app, she is greeted in Bangla with a prompt to “Start Quiz”—no accounts, no installations, no distracting pop-ups. Curious, Mina begins her first 10-question session. Each question presents a clear Arabic word with four Bangla translations. As she answers, the app smoothly moves to the next, offering instant visible feedback on correctness.

After the final question, a friendly summary appears: Mina quickly sees which words she missed and a motivating message. She’s surprised to learn the site will automatically bring back these missed words later without her needing to track anything. Clicking “Home,” she notices there’s a running count of words waiting each day—a gentle nudge when enough are due.

Mina experiments with adjusting the font size for easier reading and is relieved that everything works seamlessly on her phone and desktop. She never worries about privacy; her progress is always local, with an option to reset if she likes. Mina leaves the session confident, knowing she can dip in for daily 10-minute learning bursts, seeing steady progress in a way that fits her schedule—and her data stays hers alone. The business, meanwhile, sees adoption and engagement spike with zero backend costs or support overhead.
